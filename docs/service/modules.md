# Environment Modules

## Overview
The Environment Modules (Lmod) is a tool to help users manage their Unix or Linux shell environment, by allowing groups of related environment-variable settings to be made or removed dynamically.

Lmod is a Lua-based module system that easily handles the MODULEPATH hierarchical problem. Lmod provide a convenient way to dynamically change the usersâ€™ environment through modulefiles. 

This includes easily adding or removing directories to the PATH environment variable. Modulefiles for library packages provide environment variables that specify where the library and header files can be found.
