Requesting accounts
===================
Before you use GSDC's TEM cluster, you should send an application form to TEM service manager by e-mail and 
get an user account to access the computing cluster (please see `APPENDIX : Application Form & Materials <https://tem-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/app.html#appendix-application-form-materials-newi>`_ section). 
If you already have valid user accounts, 
you can make a connection to UI (user interface) login servers to use various kind of cluster computing/storage resources and software environments (including data analysis tools, e.g., relion, cisTEM, CryoSPARC, etc.).

.. note::
    When you first connect to the login servers, you can connect using only your password (or initial password), but you MUST immediately receive OTP (One-Time-Password)s for two-factor authentication.
    After the sucessful login, at ssh terminal, please follow the OTP guide to enable it. :ref:`2fa`
