# OTP (One-Time-Password)

## Two-factor Authentication(2FA) with OTP Guide
We have introduced a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using One-Time-Password (OTP) to enhance the security environment. 
Please follow the GSDC OTP guide (written in both Korean and English) through the link below to enable it on your TEM account or sub-IDs. You are strongly recommended to do so as soon as possible because once all TEM user accounts are OTP enabled, 
then we plan to suspend the policy requiring source IPs.
