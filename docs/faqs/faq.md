## Accounts/Password/OTP

??? question "(OTP) How can I resolve the IPA command error when getting OTP?"

    This error occurs when the credentials issued by your authentication system, which are valid for one day, expire or become invalid. Here are the steps to resolve this problem. 
    
    Open your login terminal and execute the following command to obtain new credentials.
    
    ```bash
    $> kinit
    Password for [UserID]@SDFARM.KR: (Enter your password)
    ```

    Enter your password and press Enter to generate new credentials. Now, re-run the `ipa otptoken-add` command. It should execute without errors, using the newly generated credentials.

??? question "(OTP) How can I resolve `Unable to display QR code` error?"

    When connecting to the GSDC login server via a lab workstation/desktop using the GNOME Terminal in a Linux system (e.g., Ubuntu), executing the `ipa otptoken-add` command results in the message `ipa: WARNING: Unable to display QR code using the configured output encoding. Please use the token URI to configure your OTP device`.

    To resolve this issue, you can force the use of a locale supported by the internal Python QR code package within the ipa tool. Use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    $> LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 ipa otptoken-add --algo=sha512
    ```

??? question "(LOCK+OTP) Releasing screen lock"

    When the screen lock is activated while using OTP, it prompts for a password with a message like :

    ```bash
    Screen used by [UserName] <[UserID]> on [LoginServerName].
    Password:
    ```

    ```bash
    This tty (pts/1) is not a virtual console.

    The pts/1 is now locked by [UserID].
    Password: 
    ```

    What password should I use to unlock it? To unlock the screen in this scenario, you should enter both the `First Factor` (usually your regular password string) and the `Second Factor` (the 6 digits OTP code generated by your OTP token). Combining these two factors (with consequtive password + otp) will allow you to unlock the screen and continue using your session.

??? question "How to migrate CryoSPARC's `TEM-FARM` lane from old EL7 to new AL9-based cluster?"

    `TEM-FARM` lane information (stored in Cryosparc database) needs to be updated mainly due to the difference between Torque and PBSPro batch systems.

    ```yaml
        a text
    ```

    ```yaml
        b text
    ```
