GSDC TEM Computing Cluster based on AlmaLinux 9.x
*************************************************

1. Service overview
===================

GSDC (Global Science experimental Data hub Center) provides data computing services, i.e., large-scale Cryo-EM data transfer, archiving and/or processing to Cryo-EM operators/users.
Cryo-EM facilities which are operated by government-funded research institutes or academies, can be directly connected to GSDC via KREONET with 10+ Gbps dedicated/shared network links. 
GSDC also supports petabyes scale of high performance (and/or archiving) storages and CPU/GPU computing servers to help Cryo-EM users' scientific discoveries. 
Here is GSDC's computing and storage infrastructres for Cryo-EM operators/users.


Overall architecture between KBSI, SNU (Seoul National University), PNU (Pusan National University)'s Cryo-EM facilities and GSDC TEM computing cluster.
