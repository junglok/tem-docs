## Overview
GSDC (Global Science experimental Data hub Center) provides data computing services, i.e., large-scale Cryo-EM data transfer archiving and/or processing to Cryo-EM operators/users.Cryo-EM facilities which are operated by government-funded research institutes or academies, can be directly connected to GSDC via KREONET with 10+ Gbps dedicated/shared network links. GSDC also supports petabyes scale of high performance (and/or archiving) storages and CPU/GPU computing servers to help Cryo-EM users' scientific discoveries. Here is GSDC's computing and storage infrastructres for Cryo-EM operators/users.
