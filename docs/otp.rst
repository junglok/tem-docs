Two-factor Authentication (2FA) with One-Time-Password (OTP) |newi|

One-Time-Passowrd (OTP) Guide
=============================

We have introduced a two-factor authentication using OTP (One-Time-Password) to enhance the security environment. Please follow the GSDC OTP guide (written in both Korean and English) through the link below 
to enable it on your TEM account. Note that you must follow the guide when you are already logged in. 

* `GSDC OTP Guide <https://gsdc-farm.gitbook.io/gsdc-otp/>`_

You are strongly recommended to do so as soon as possible because once all TEM user accounts are OTP enabled, then we plan to suspend the policy requiring source IPs. 

We hope your cooperation and please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.
