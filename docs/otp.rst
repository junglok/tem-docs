2FA with One-Time-Passowrd (OTP) Guide
======================================

We have introduced a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using One-Time-Password (OTP) to enhance the security environment. Please follow the GSDC OTP guide (written in both Korean and English) through the link below 
to enable it on your TEM account. Note that you must follow the guide when you are already logged in. 

* `GSDC OTP Guide <https://gsdc-farm.gitbook.io/gsdc-otp/>`_

You are strongly recommended to do so as soon as possible because once all TEM user accounts are OTP enabled, then we plan to suspend the policy requiring source IPs. 

We hope your cooperation and please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.


2FA Tips and Tricks
===================

How can I use ssh/sftp GUI with 2FA?
------------------------------------

Your client (e.g., Linux/Mac GUI terminal programs) may natively support interactive or multi-factor authentication methods. However, many GUI programs do not have this functionality built in.

Known GUI applications for ssh that support 2FA natively:

    * Linux/MAC GUI terminal programs
    * MobaXterm (`Connecting via MobaXterm <https://gsdc-farm.gitbook.io/gsdc-otp/login-with-otp#mobaxterm-connecting-via-mobaxterm-on-windows>`_ )
    * XShell (`Connecting using Xshell <https://gsdc-farm.gitbook.io/gsdc-otp/login-with-otp#xshell-connecting-using-xshell>`_ )
    * Putty
