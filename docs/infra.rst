TEM infrastructure overview
***************************
GSDC (Global Science experimental Data hub Center) supports data processing for Structural Biology with Cryo-EM, Lightsource, and X-ray Laser experiments.
Cryo-EM instrumentations are operated by KBSI. Cryo-EM facilities are directly connected to GSDC Datacenter through KREONet with 10Gbps dedicated/shared optical fiber links. GSDC provides Peta-bytes scale of storages and GPU equipped computational power. Here is an overview of GSDC's TEM infrastructre for Cryo-EM users.
