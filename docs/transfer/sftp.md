# SFTP

## SSH/SFTP programs with 2FA

Your client (e.g., Terminal-based ssh/sftp/scp/rsync commands on Linux/Mac etc.) programs may natively support interactive or multi-factor authentication methods.

* CLI (Command Line Interface) terminal programs (for Linux or Mac) : [SSH/SFTP/SCP/RSYNC via terminal-based commands](../account/ssh.md)

However, many GUI programs do not have this functionality built in. Known GUI applications for SSH that support 2FA natively:

* MobaXterm (for Windows only) : [SSH via MobaXterm](https://gsdc-farm.gitbook.io/gsdc-otp/login-with-otp#mobaxterm-connecting-via-mobaxterm-on-windows)
* XShell (for Windows only) : [SSH using Xshell](https://gsdc-farm.gitbook.io/gsdc-otp/login-with-otp#xshell-connecting-using-xshell)
* Putty

Known GUI applications for SFTP that support 2FA natively:

* FileZilla (for Windows or Linux/Mac) : see [Data uploadind/downloading via FileZilla with 2FA](./filezilla.md)
* WinSCP (for Windows only) : see [Data uploading/downloading via WinSCP with 2FA](./winscp.md)
